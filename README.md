## Install (Backup your old config before you do this!)

Install by running

`git clone https://github.com/VampyricDark/emacs.git ~/.emacs.d/ && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VampyricDark/emacs/main/vampyricdark-theme.el ~/.emacs./vampyricdark-theme.el`

After that you can install the theme you just wget-ed with
`M-x package-install-file ~/.emacs.d/vampyricdark-theme.el`
inside emacs.
